# ML-Diabetes-Predictions

### Nowadays a spike is seen in mortality linked to diabetes. Diabetes is known as one of the most critical human diseases in the contemporary world that has a serious impact on quality of life. Diabetes could be a chronic disease that happens either when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces or when the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin [1]. The early methods of forecasting diabetes help in avoiding health damage; however, inaccurate diabetes prediction can prove to be lethal. The machine learning algorithm can be very efficient in the prediction of diabetes due to enormous medical data in the healthcare industry. In the proposed study, various data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to compare the prediction analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. I used six popular classification algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Linear SVM, and KNN, and some classifier performance evaluation metrics such as Hyperparameter tuning, confusion matrix, cross-validation, ROC, and AUC. The Random Forest classifier shows the best algorithm among these six models in terms of accuracy level (%78.57). Within the final chapter, an analytical comparison has been provided to assist medical professionals working in this field.
